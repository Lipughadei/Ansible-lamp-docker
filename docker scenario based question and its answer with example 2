Certainly! Here are some scenario-based questions related to Docker, along with their answers and examples.

Scenario 1: Container Isolation
Question: You have a web application that requires a specific version of Node.js. How can you ensure that this application runs in isolation without affecting other applications on the same host?

Answer: You can create a Docker container that includes the specific version of Node.js required by your application.
By using Docker, you can package your application along with its dependencies, ensuring that it runs in isolation from other applications.

Example:

Create a Dockerfile for your Node.js application:

Dockerfile

Verify
Copy code
FROM node:14  # Use a specific version of Node.js
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
Build the Docker image:

bash

Verify
Copy code
docker build -t my-node-app .
Run the container:

bash

Verify
Copy code
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
