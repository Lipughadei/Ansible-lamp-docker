In the context of container orchestration, particularly with Kubernetes, a "pod" is the smallest deployable unit and can contain one or more containers.

Single-container Pod: The most common use case is a pod that contains a single container. This is straightforward and is often used for simple applications.

Multi-container Pod: A pod can also contain multiple containers that are tightly coupled and need to work together.
                     These containers share the same network namespace (meaning they can communicate with each other via localhost) and can also share storage volumes.
                     This is useful for scenarios like sidecar containers, where one container provides a supporting function to the main application container (e.g., logging, monitoring, or proxying).

In summary, yes, a pod can contain multiple containers, but it can also contain just one. The design choice depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application being deployed.
