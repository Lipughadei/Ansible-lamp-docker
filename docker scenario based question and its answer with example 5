Scenario 4: Scaling Applications
Question: You need to scale your web application to handle increased traffic. How can you achieve this using Docker?

Answer: You can use Docker Compose or Docker Swarm to scale your application by running multiple instances of your container.

Example using Docker Compose:

Create a docker-compose.yml file:

yaml

Verify
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: my-node-app
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
Deploy the application:

bash

Verify
Copy code
docker-compose up --scale web=3
