Why does docker push base image layers that are already on ...


forums.docker
When you push a modified image with the same tag to Docker Hub multiple times, the previously pushed image will be untaged, resulting in an orphaned or "dangling" image. This means that the new image will overwrite the old one, and the old one will no longer be accessible by its tag.

What happens during download?

When you push an image to Docker Hub, the client will perform what is referred to as a "cross-repository blob mount", which makes a blob from a different repository available in the one being pushed. This means that if you base your image on another public image, users of your image will not have to download your copy of the layers of the public base image again, even if they already have them.

Docker Push Command

The docker push command is essential for uploading your container images to a registry. For those looking to understand Docker's full capabilities, the DevOps Engineering – Planning to Production course covers Docker push and other key Docker commands in a DevOps workflow.

Pushing an Image to Docker Hub

To push an image to Docker Hub, you need to tag your image with the Docker Hub username and repository name. For example:

docker

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
If you do not mention the tag, then the default tag is the latest. For example:

docker

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
docker tag ubuntu:14.04 XYZ/ubuntu:2.0
Login to Docker Hub

Before pushing the image, you need to log in to your Docker Hub account. To login, the command is:

docker

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
docker login
Push the Image

After logging in, you can push the image using the following command:

docker

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
docker push XYZ/ubuntu:2.0
Push All Tags of an Image

If you want to push all the tags of an image, you can use the -a or --all-tags flag. For example:

docker

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
docker push -a my_image
This will push all the tags of the my_image image to the registry.


what will happen if we push same image without modifying the image to the dockerhub multiple time


When you push the same image to Docker Hub multiple times without making any modifications, the following occurs:

1. Layer Caching
Docker uses a layer caching mechanism, which means that if the image hasn't changed, Docker will not re-upload the unchanged layers. Instead, it will recognize that the layers already exist on Docker Hub and will skip the upload for those layers.
2. Image Tagging
If you push the image with the same tag, Docker Hub will simply confirm that the image layers are already present. The image will still be associated with the same tag, and no new image will be created or overwrite the existing one.
3. No New Image Created
Since the image content is unchanged, no new image digest will be generated. The digest is a unique identifier for the image based on its content, and it will remain the same as the previous push.
4. No Impact on Storage
Because Docker Hub recognizes that the image has not changed, there will be no additional storage impact from pushing the same image multiple times.
Example Command
If you were to push the same image again, the command would look like this:

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
docker push XYZ/ubuntu:2.0
Conclusion
In summary, pushing the same image without modifications will not result in any changes to the existing image on Docker Hub, and it will not incur additional storage costs or create new image digests. If you would like to know more about specific scenarios or commands, feel free to ask!


what will happen if we push same image to the ECR multiple time


When you push the same image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) multiple times without making any modifications, the following occurs:

1. Image Validation
ECR will validate the image to ensure it meets the required standards and formats.
2. Layer Caching
ECR uses a layer caching mechanism, similar to Docker Hub. If the image hasn't changed, ECR will not re-upload the unchanged layers. Instead, it will recognize that the layers already exist in the registry and will skip the upload for those layers.
3. Image Tagging
If you push the image with the same tag, ECR will update the image manifest to point to the existing layers. The image will still be associated with the same tag, and no new image will be created or overwrite the existing one.
4. No New Image Created
Since the image content is unchanged, no new image digest will be generated. The digest is a unique identifier for the image based on its content, and it will remain the same as the previous push.
5. No Impact on Storage
Because ECR recognizes that the image has not changed, there will be no additional storage impact from pushing the same image multiple times.
6. ** Billing and Cost**
Since ECR only stores the image layers once, you will not incur additional storage costs for pushing the same image multiple times. However, you may still incur costs for the API requests and data transfer associated with the push operation.
Example Command
If you were to push the same image again, the command would look like this:

bash

Verify

Copy code
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] <account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
docker push <account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
Conclusion
In summary, pushing the same image without modifications to ECR will not result in any changes to the existing image, and it will not incur additional storage costs or create new image digests. If you would like to know more about specific scenarios or commands, feel free to ask!


what will happen if we push same image with changes to the image to the dockerhub multiple time


When you push an image with changes to Docker Hub multiple times, the following occurs:

1. New Layers Created
If you modify the image (e.g., by changing files, adding new files, or updating configurations), Docker will create new layers for those changes. Each modification results in a new layer being added to the image.
2. Image Tagging
When you push the modified image, you typically use the same tag as before. This means that the new image will overwrite the existing image with that tag on Docker Hub, and the old image will be untagged.
3. New Image Digest
Each image has a unique digest based on its content. When you push a modified image, a new digest will be generated for the updated image, distinguishing it from the previous version.
4. Storage Impact
The new layers will be stored in Docker Hub, which may increase your storage usage. However, if any layers were already present from previous images (due to layer caching), those layers will not be duplicated, and only the new layers will consume additional storage.
5. Pulling the Image
When someone pulls the image with the same tag after you’ve pushed the modified version, they will receive the latest version of the image, including all the changes.
Example Command
If you modified your image and want to push it, your commands would look like this:

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
# Tag the modified image
docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

# Push the modified image
docker push TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
Conclusion
In summary, pushing a modified image to Docker Hub will overwrite the existing image with the same tag, create new layers for the changes, generate a new image digest, and potentially increase your storage usage depending on the nature of the modifications.
