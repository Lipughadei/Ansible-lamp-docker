Containers are considered lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs) for several reasons, primarily related to their architecture and the way they utilize system resources.
Here are the key factors that contribute to the lightweight nature of containers:

1. Shared Operating System Kernel
Single Kernel: Containers share the host operating system's kernel, which means they do not require a full operating system for each instance. 
This contrasts with VMs, which each run their own complete OS, including a separate kernel.
Efficiency: By sharing the kernel, containers can start up much faster and use significantly less disk space and memory compared to VMs, which need to load their entire OS.
2. Resource Utilization
Minimal Overhead: Containers package only the application and its dependencies, without the overhead of an entire operating system. This leads to lower resource consumption.
On-Demand Resources: Containers can be allocated resources dynamically based on their needs, allowing for efficient use of the host's CPU and memory.
3. Layered Filesystem
Copy-on-Write: Container images are built using a layered filesystem, where each layer represents a set of changes.
This means that multiple containers can share common layers, reducing the amount of disk space needed.
Fast Deployment: Since layers can be reused across containers, deploying new instances can be much faster as only the new or changed layers need to be downloaded or created.
4. Rapid Startup Times
Instant Launch: Containers can start almost instantaneously because they do not have to boot an entire operating system.
This makes them ideal for microservices architectures where applications need to scale up and down quickly.
Quick Scaling: The rapid startup time allows for efficient scaling of applications in response to demand.
5. Isolation without Virtualization Overhead
Namespace and Cgroups: Containers use Linux features like namespaces and control groups (cgroups) to provide isolation and resource management without the overhead of full virtualization.
This allows containers to run in isolated environments while still being lightweight.
Less Complexity: The absence of a hypervisor layer reduces complexity and overhead, allowing for more efficient use of system resources.
6. Portability and Consistency
Environment Consistency: Containers encapsulate everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables),
ensuring that they run consistently across different environments (development, testing, production) without the need for significant overhead.
Cross-Platform: Because containers can run on any system that supports the container runtime (like Docker), they can be easily moved between different hosts without compatibility issues.
7. Simplified Management
Easier Updates and Rollbacks: Containers can be easily updated or rolled back by simply replacing the container image, which is a lightweight operation compared to managing full VMs.
Microservices Architecture: Containers are often used to deploy microservices, allowing for fine-grained scaling and management of individual application components without the overhead of managing entire VMs.
Conclusion
In summary, containers are lightweight due to their architecture, which leverages shared operating systems, minimal overhead, efficient resource utilization,
rapid startup times, and the use of layered filesystems. These characteristics make containers an attractive option for modern application development and deployment,
particularly in cloud-native and microservices environments.
