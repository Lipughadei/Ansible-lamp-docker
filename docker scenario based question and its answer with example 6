Scenario 5: CI/CD Integration
Question: How can you integrate Docker into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of your application?

Answer: You can use Docker in your CI/CD pipeline to build images, run tests, and deploy containers automatically. Most CI/CD tools (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) support Docker natively.

Example using GitHub Actions:

Create a .github/workflows/docker.yml file:
yaml

Verify
Copy code
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-node-app .

      - name: Run tests
        run: docker run my-node-app npm test

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
          docker tag my-node-app my-docker-repo/my-node-app:latest
          docker push my-docker-repo/my-node-app:latest
These scenarios cover various aspects of Docker, including isolation, data persistence, networking, scaling, and CI/CD integration.
Each example provides a practical approach to solving common challenges when working with Docker.
