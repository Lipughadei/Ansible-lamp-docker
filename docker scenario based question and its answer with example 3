Scenario 2: Data Persistence
Question: You need to ensure that the data generated by your application persists even after the container is stopped or removed. How can you achieve this?

Answer: You can use Docker volumes to persist data generated by your application. Volumes are stored outside of the container filesystem and can be reused across container instances.

Example:

Create a volume:

bash

Verify
Copy code
docker volume create my-data
Run a container with the volume attached:

bash

Verify
Copy code
docker run -d -v my-data:/app/data my-node-app
Data written to /app/data inside the container will persist in the my-data volume even if the container is stopped or removed.
