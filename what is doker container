-> A Docker container is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained environment where you can run your applications.
   It's like a "virtual machine" that runs on top of your operating system, but it's more efficient and shares the host's resources.

-> Here are the key points about Docker containers:

-> Isolation: Containers provide a separate space for your application to run, keeping it isolated from other applications and the host system.

-> Portability: Containers can be easily moved between different systems, making it simple to deploy your application in various environments.

-> Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and use fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines, allowing you to run more applications on the same hardware.

-> Consistency: Containers ensure that your application runs the same way, regardless of the environment it's in, making it easier to manage and maintain.

-> In simple words, a Docker container is a convenient and efficient way to package and run your applications.
