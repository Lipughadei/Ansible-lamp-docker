The Docker daemon is a background program that runs on your computer or server and manages Docker containers.
You can think of it as the "worker" that does all the tasks related to creating, running, and managing containers when you give it commands through the Docker client.
It handles everything needed to keep your applications running in isolated environments called containers.
