The -v option in Docker is used to mount volumes, allowing you to share files between the host and the container.
This is useful for persisting data or sharing configuration files. For example, you might use -v /host/path:/container/path to link a directory from your host to a directory in your container.

Example Command

bash

Verify
Copy code
$ docker run -d -v /host/path:/container/path your-image
-d: Runs the container in detached mode.
-v /host/path:/container/path: Mounts the host directory /host/path to the container directory /container/path.
your-image: The name of the Docker image you want to run.
Use Cases for -v

Data Persistence: When you want to keep data generated by the container even after it stops or is removed.
Configuration Sharing: To share configuration files between the host and the container, making it easier to manage settings.
Development: During development, you can mount your source code into the container, allowing for live updates without rebuilding the image.
Example with a Web Application

If you are running a web application and want to mount your application code:

bash

Verify
Copy code
$ docker run -d -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app -p 5000:5000 your-web-app
$(pwd): This command gets the current directory path, which is mounted to /usr/src/app in the container.
-p 5000:5000: Maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on the host, allowing access to the web application.
Using the -v option effectively can greatly enhance your workflow with Docker containers.
