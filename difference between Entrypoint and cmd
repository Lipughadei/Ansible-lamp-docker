In Docker, both ENTRYPOINT and CMD are instructions used in a Dockerfile to specify what command should be run when a container is started.
However, they serve different purposes and have different behaviors. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the differences:

ENTRYPOINT
Purpose: The ENTRYPOINT instruction is used to define the main command that will always be executed when the container starts. It is typically used to set up the container to run a specific application.

Behavior: The command specified in ENTRYPOINT cannot be overridden at runtime (unless you use the --entrypoint flag with docker run). It is designed to be the primary command for the container.

Syntax: You can specify ENTRYPOINT in two forms:

Exec form (recommended): ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
Shell form: ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (this runs in a shell)
Example:

dockerfile

Verify

Open In Editor
Run
Copy code
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
CMD
Purpose: The CMD instruction provides default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT or specifies a command to run when the container starts if no command is provided at runtime.

Behavior: If you specify a command when running the container, it will override the CMD instruction. If ENTRYPOINT is also specified, the command in CMD will be passed as arguments to the ENTRYPOINT.

Syntax: Similar to ENTRYPOINT, CMD can also be specified in two forms:

Exec form: CMD ["param1", "param2"]
Shell form: CMD command param1 param2
Example:

dockerfile

Verify

Open In Editor
Run
Copy code
CMD ["--help"]
Combined Usage
You can use both ENTRYPOINT and CMD together in a Dockerfile. In this case, ENTRYPOINT defines the main command, and CMD provides default arguments to that command.

Example:
dockerfile

Verify

Open In Editor
Run
Copy code
FROM python:3.8
COPY app.py /app.py
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app.py"]
CMD ["--help"]
In this example, when you run the container without any arguments, it will execute python /app.py --help.
If you run the container with a different argument, like docker run myimage --version, it will execute python /app.py --version.

Summary
Use ENTRYPOINT to define the main command that should always run.
Use CMD to provide default arguments or to specify a command that can be overridden at runtime.
They can be used together, where ENTRYPOINT is the main command and CMD provides default arguments.
