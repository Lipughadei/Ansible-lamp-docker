The Docker client is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with Docker, which is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
In simple terms, the Docker client lets you run commands to create, manage, and control your containers and images.
You can think of it as the interface through which you communicate with the Docker engine to perform tasks like building applications,
running them, and managing their lifecycle.
