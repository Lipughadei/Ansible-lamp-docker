Scenario 3: Networking
Question: You have multiple containers that need to communicate with each other. How can you set up networking between these containers?

Answer: You can create a user-defined bridge network in Docker, which allows containers to communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames.

Example:

Create a network:

bash

Verify
Copy code
docker network create my-network
Run two containers on the same network:

bash

Verify
Copy code
docker run -d --name web-app --network my-network my-node-app
docker run -d --name db --network my-network my-database-image
The web-app container can communicate with the db container using the hostname db.
